##Introduction to Gemeni 
- I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it. AI has the potential to create opportunities â€” from the everyday to the extraordinary â€” for people everywhere. It will bring new waves of innovation and economic progress and drive knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity on a scale we havenâ€™t seen before.

###What is Gemeni ?
- Gemini AI is a new AI model developed by Googleâ€™s DeepMind and Google Brain teams.

##Why Gemeni AI Developed ?
- For understanding this that why Gemeni is developed ? But what if I say that answer of this question You know AlreadyðŸ˜Š.This sounds funny Right ? Ok now let me answer for Your question and how do you know that answer . In the recent Days you heared about the name of ChatGPT for a couple of times And You also May be tried it atleast for one time for sure . So while Using ChatGPT you have noticed a thing that you Ask questions in Form of Text Only And Also if you asked for giving any image it didn't give you. But what if a person wants to ask a question in a Audio Format ?  What if he wants to ask for a image or video ?
- So Basically Gemeni AI is developed to make it multimodal Ai Model where any person with the  help of audio , video ,images , code , text can ask the question and also get their answers  . Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research.

## Versions of Gemini 
Gemini comes in three versions:
- Gemini Ultra - largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.
- Gemini Pro -  best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.
- Gemini Nano - most efficient model for on-device tasks.

## What are the qualities of Different Gemeni Version ?
With a score of 90.0%, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities.

Google's new benchmark approach to MMLU enables Gemini to use its reasoning capabilities to think more carefully before answering difficult questions, leading to significant improvements over just using its first impression.



# MMLU -> MMLU stands for Massive Multitask Language Understanding. It is a benchmark designed to measure the performance of language models on various tasks such as humanities, STEM, social sciences, and others



### Benefits of Gemeni 1.0 ?
Gemini 1.0â€™s sophisticated multimodal reasoning capabilities can help make sense of complex written and visual information. This makes it uniquely skilled at uncovering knowledge that can be difficult to discern amid vast amounts of data.

Its remarkable ability to extract insights from hundreds of thousands of documents through reading, filtering and understanding information will help deliver new breakthroughs at digital speeds in many fields from science to finance.

Gemini 1.0 was trained to recognize and understand text, images, audio and more at the same time, so it better understands nuanced information and can answer questions relating to complicated topics. This makes it especially good at explaining reasoning in complex subjects like math and physics.

 Gemini can understand, explain and generate high-quality code in the worldâ€™s most popular programming languages, like Python, Java, C++, and Go. Its ability to work across languages and reason about complex information makes it one of the leading foundation models for coding in the world.


 ### How can You Use it ?



 ### Conclusion -> 
 Gemeni is a future of innovation that will enhance creativity, extend knowledge, advance science and transform the way billions of people live and work around the world.
