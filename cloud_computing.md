# CLOUD COMPUTING


## **INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING**

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider

### Advantages of Cloud Computing:
1. _Back-up and restore data_: 
Once the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud.

2. _Excellent accessibility_: Cloud allows us to quickly and easily access store information anywhere, anytime in the whole world, using an internet connection. 

3. _Low maintenance cost_: Cloud computing reduces both hardware and software maintenance costs for organizations.

4. _Unlimited storage capacity_: Cloud offers us a huge amount of storing capacity for storing our important data such as documents, images, audio, video, etc. in one place.

5. _Data security_: Data security is one of the biggest advantages of cloud computing. Cloud offers many advanced features related to security and ensures that data is securely stored and handled.
