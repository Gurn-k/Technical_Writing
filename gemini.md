# Gemini AI 

Gemini is a powerful series of multimodal generative AI models developed by Google. These models are designed to handle text and image inputs, providing a versatile solution for various applications.

## Key Features

- **Text and Image Input:** Gemini models seamlessly process text and image inputs in prompts, making them highly flexible for multimodal interactions.

- **PaLM Models for Text Responses:** Legacy PaLM models within Gemini accept text-only inputs and generate text responses.

- **MMLU Performance:** Gemini has achieved a remarkable feat by outperforming human experts on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), a popular benchmark for testing AI models' knowledge and problem-solving abilities.

- **Gemini API for NLP Tasks:** The Gemini API supports text-only input, allowing users to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text completion and summarization.

- **Vision-related Tasks:** The Gemini-pro-vision model, part of the Gemini API, can handle text prompts with images, making it suitable for vision-related tasks like image captioning and object identification.

- **Interactive Chat Experiences:** Leverage the Gemini API to build interactive user chat experiences. The chat feature enables the collection of multiple rounds of questions and responses, facilitating incremental steps toward answers or assistance with multi-part problems.

## Model Variations

1. **Gemini Ultra:** The largest and most capable model designed for highly complex tasks.

2. **Gemini Pro:** Considered the best model for scaling across various tasks, offering a balanced performance profile.

3. **Gemini Nano:** The most efficient model tailored for on-device tasks, emphasizing resource efficiency.
