# HDD and SSD Storage Technologies 

## Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

- **Spinning Platter**: The platter is a circular magnetic disk containing tracks and sectors that retain data.
- **Actuator Arm**: The actuator arm moves across the platter to read and write data.

## Solid State Drive (SSD)

- **Integrated Circuit**: The integrated circuit is a sort of collection of electronic circuits embedded in a silicon semiconductor.
- **Flash Memory**: SSDs work using flash memory to store and access data.
- **Charge in Semiconductors**: SSDs use charge in semiconductors.

### HDD Features, Limitations, and Concepts

- they have Moving parts which lead to vibrations and higher power consumption.
- they are a Good choice for more GBs of data for a cheaper price.
- they are Trustworthy.
- Boot-ups are slow.
- It is Comparatively heavy.
- More vulnerable to wear and tear.

### SSD Features, Limitations, and Concepts

- They don't have moving parts, don't vibrate, and do not have high power consumption
- They become largely expensive as one goes for a high range of GBs.
- Gaining popularity recently.
- Renowned for quick bootups; i.e., the rate at which it accesses the data is far more elevated than that of the HDD.
- The weight of SSD is less.
- Vulnerable to data leaks.
